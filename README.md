# MPU6050 Code for a Gesture-Controlled Room Project

## A code written in the Arduino IDE using C++ for an MPU6050 sensor that controls LEDs, servo motors and a fan

This code was for an MPU6050 sensor used in a gesture-controlled room. Hand gestures can be set using certain values for the accelerometer and the gyroscope.
