# MPU6050 Code for a Gesture-Controlled Room Project

## A code written in the Arduino IDE using C++ for an MPU6050 sensor that controls LEDs, servo motors and a fan

Controlling lights, fan, servos and any other component as you like using hand gestures with this code. This project uses an MPU6050 sensor with an in-built accelerometer and gyroscope to detect gestures based on specific values of the accelerometer and/or gyroscope.

## Features
* Gesture Recognition – Swipe, tilt, and lift detection
* Multi-Device Control – LED dimming, fan ON/OFF, curtain open/close
* Noise Filtering – Deadzone + averaging for stable readings
* LCD Feedback – Real-time status display
* Calibration – Automatic sensor calibration
